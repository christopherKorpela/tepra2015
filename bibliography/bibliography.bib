  Abstract                 = {We present an efficient approach to generating paths for humanoids and other robotic manipulators that uses the Task Space Region (TSR) framework to specify manipulation tasks. TSRs can define acceptable goal poses of an end-effector or constraints on the end-effector's pose during the path, or both. First presented as a method for goal-specification, TSRs are a straightforward representation of sets of end-effector poses which can be sampled and which entail a clear distance metric. This makes TSRs ideal for sampling-based motion planning. However, a finite set of TSRs is sometimes insufficient to capture the pose constraints of a given task. To describe more complex constraints, we present TSR Chains, which are defined by linking a series of TSRs. Though the sampling for TSR Chains follows clearly from that of TSRs, the distance metric for TSR Chains is radically different. We also present a new version of our Constrained Bidirectional RRT (CBiRRT2) planner, which is capable of planning with TSR chains as well as other constraints. We demonstrate our approach on the HRP3 robot by performing a variety of whole-body manipulation tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {We present the Constrained Bi-directional Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (CBiRRT) algorithm for planning paths in configuration spaces with multiple constraints. This algorithm provides a general framework for handling a variety of constraints in manipulation planning including torque limits, constraints on the pose of an object held by a robot, and constraints for following workspace surfaces. CBiRRT extends the Bi-directional RRT (BiRRT) algorithm by using projection techniques to explore the configuration space manifolds that correspond to constraints and to find bridges between them. Consequently, CBiRRT can solve many problems that the BiRRT cannot, and only requires one additional parameter: the allowable error for meeting a constraint. We demonstrate the CBiRRT on a 7DOF WAM arm with a 4DOF Barrett hand on a mobile base. The planner allows this robot to perform household tasks, solve puzzles, and lift heavy objects.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce the concept of a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) as a randomized data structure that is designed for a broad class of path planning problems. While they share many of the beneficial properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics) and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},

In particular, this paper establishes key reasons the RRT is valuable as a planning method. Primarily, the RRT explores space well, is probabilisticalyl complete in the basic formulation (i.e. a search of joint space). If a solution exists, the RRT will find it, though the exploration may take a long time. These important details are laid out in section},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present efficient solutions for planning motions of dual-arm manipulation and re-grasping tasks. Motion planning for such tasks on humanoid robots with a high number of degrees of freedom (DoF) requires computationally efficient approaches to determine the robot's full joint configuration at a given grasping position, i.e. solving the Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem for one or both hands of the robot. In this context, we investigate solving the inverse kinematics problem and motion planning for dual-arm manipulation and re-grasping tasks by combining a gradient-descent approach in the robot's pre-computed reachability space with random sampling of free parameters. This strategy provides feasible IK solutions at a low computation cost without resorting to iterative methods which could be trapped by joint-limits. We apply this strategy to dual-arm motion planning tasks in which the robot is holding an object with one hand in order to generate whole-body robot configurations suitable for grasping the object with both hands. In addition, we present two probabilistically complete RRT-based motion planning algorithms (J+-RRT and IK-RRT) that interleave the search for an IK solution with the search for a collision-free trajectory and the extension of these planners to solving re-grasping problems. The capabilities of combining IK methods and planners are shown both in simulation and on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III performing dual-arm tasks in a kitchen environment.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, we present an integrated planner for collision-free single and dual arm grasping motions. The proposed Grasp-RRT planner combines the three main tasks needed for grasping an object: finding a feasible grasp, solving the inverse kinematics and searching a collision-free trajectory that brings the hand to the grasping pose. Therefore, RRT-based algorithms are used to build a tree of reachable and collision-free configurations. During RRT-generation, potential grasping positions are generated and approach movements toward them are computed. The quality of reachable grasping poses is scored with an online grasp quality measurement module which is based on the computation of applied forces in order to diminish the net torque.We also present an extension to a dual arm planner which generates bimanual grasps together with corresponding dual arm grasping motions. The algorithms are evaluated with different setups in simulation and on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III.},

  Review                   = {This paper presentes an algorithm (Grasp-RRT) that integrates grasp quality checks into the RRT search for a goal. It works by storing the grasper's position (6D) for each node found in the RRT that is not in collision. Sampling an approach direction from a bounding sphere, the nearest RRT node is chosen to evaluate grasp quality. This gives a non-uniform distribution of sampling nodes, but returns a better variety of solutions. Finally, grasp quality is evaluated by a different algorithm than the contact wrench space.

Need to know more about:

Grasp-RRT in action. Look for a plugin or implement something like this in MATLAB?
Grasp pose evaluation using CWS....could this be useful for feet as well?
Their zero-net-torque algorithm, how does it work exactly? Need to attempt this in 2D or at least read more about it.

Conclusion:

This paper is very important as a starting point for grasp analysis. Need to read a lot of the background literature.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a sampling-based path planning algorithm capable of efficiently generating solutions for high-dimensional manipulation problems involving challenging inverse kinematics and complex obstacles. Our algorithm extends the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm to cope with goals that are specified in a subspace of the manipulator configuration space through which the search tree is being grown. Underspecified goals occur naturally in arm planning, where the final end effector position is crucial but the configuration of the rest of the arm is not. To achieve this, the algorithm bootstraps an optimal local controller based on the transpose of the Jacobian to a global RRT search. The resulting approach, known as Jacobian transpose-directed rapidly exploring random trees (JT-RRTs), is able to combine the configuration space exploration of RRTs with a workspace goal bias to produce direct paths through complex environments extremely efficiently, without the need for any inverse kinematics. We compare our algorithm to a recently-developed competing approach and provide results from both simulation and a 7 degree-of-freedom robotic arm.},

  Abstract                 = {Path planning for redundant robotic manipulators received continuous interest in the past decades. Most efforts focused on random sampling-based methods, such as probabilistic roadmap method (PRM) and rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT), since they are suitable for planning in high-dimensional configuration space. Given the workspace goal position and orientation of the end-effector, however, explicitly calculating a collision-free and reachable goal configuration for robot joint angles in the presence of joint limits and self-collisions is not a trivial work. The difficulty forms a bottleneck for the broader applicability of the randomized path planning methods. In this paper, a novel two-stage approach is presented to implicitly solve the formation of inverse kinematics (IK) problems, which employs a variant of RRT to embed the process of IK calculation into construction and exploration of the tree-based data structure. Combined with bidirectional RRT-connect algorithm, the two-stage approach can efficiently address the path planning problem for general redundant manipulators. The algorithm has been implemented and several 2D and 3D experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.},
