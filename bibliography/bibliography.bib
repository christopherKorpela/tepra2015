	goal poses of an end-effector or constraints on the end-effector's

  journal = {Robotics and Automation, 2009. ICRA '09. IEEE International Conference

  year = {2009},
  pages = {625--632},
  abstract = {We present the Constrained Bi-directional Rapidly-Exploring Random
	Tree (CBiRRT) algorithm for planning paths in configuration spaces
	with multiple constraints. This algorithm provides a general framework
	for handling a variety of constraints in manipulation planning including
	torque limits, constraints on the pose of an object held by a robot,
	and constraints for following workspace surfaces. CBiRRT extends
	the Bi-directional RRT (BiRRT) algorithm by using projection techniques
	to explore the configuration space manifolds that correspond to constraints
	and to find bridges between them. Consequently, CBiRRT can solve
	many problems that the BiRRT cannot, and only requires one additional
	parameter: the allowable error for meeting a constraint. We demonstrate
	the CBiRRT on a 7DOF WAM arm with a 4DOF Barrett hand on a mobile
	base. The planner allows this robot to perform household tasks, solve
	puzzles, and lift heavy objects.},

	as a randomized data structure that is designed for a broad class
	of path planning problems. While they share many of the beneficial
	properties of existing randomized planning techniques, RRTs are specifically
	designed to handle nonholonomic constraints (including dynamics)
	and high degrees of freedom. An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying
	control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected
	points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in
	the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties
	and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed. To date, we have
	successfully applied RRTs to holonomic, nonholonomic, and kinodynamic
	planning problems of up to twelve degrees of freedom.},

	basic formulation (i.e. a search of joint space). If a solution exists,
	the RRT will find it, though the exploration may take a long time.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present efficient solutions for planning motions
	of dual-arm manipulation and re-grasping tasks. Motion planning for
	such tasks on humanoid robots with a high number of degrees of freedom
	(DoF) requires computationally efficient approaches to determine
	the robot's full joint configuration at a given grasping position,
	i.e. solving the Inverse Kinematics (IK) problem for one or both
	hands of the robot. In this context, we investigate solving the inverse
	kinematics problem and motion planning for dual-arm manipulation
	and re-grasping tasks by combining a gradient-descent approach in
	the robot's pre-computed reachability space with random sampling
	of free parameters. This strategy provides feasible IK solutions
	at a low computation cost without resorting to iterative methods
	which could be trapped by joint-limits. We apply this strategy to
	dual-arm motion planning tasks in which the robot is holding an object
	with one hand in order to generate whole-body robot configurations
	suitable for grasping the object with both hands. In addition, we
	present two probabilistically complete RRT-based motion planning
	algorithms (J+-RRT and IK-RRT) that interleave the search for an
	IK solution with the search for a collision-free trajectory and the
	extension of these planners to solving re-grasping problems. The
	capabilities of combining IK methods and planners are shown both
	in simulation and on the humanoid robot ARMAR-III performing dual-arm
	tasks in a kitchen environment.},

	a feasible grasp, solving the inverse kinematics and searching a
	collision-free trajectory that brings the hand to the grasping pose.
	Therefore, RRT-based algorithms are used to build a tree of reachable
	and collision-free configurations. During RRT-generation, potential
	grasping positions are generated and approach movements toward them
	are computed. The quality of reachable grasping poses is scored with
	an online grasp quality measurement module which is based on the
	computation of applied forces in order to diminish the net torque.We
	also present an extension to a dual arm planner which generates bimanual

	the grasper's position (6D) for each node found in the RRT that is

	This gives a non-uniform distribution of sampling nodes, but returns

	controller based on the transpose of the Jacobian to a global RRT
	search. The resulting approach, known as Jacobian transpose-directed
	rapidly exploring random trees (JT-RRTs), is able to combine the
	configuration space exploration of RRTs with a workspace goal bias
	to produce direct paths through complex environments extremely efficiently,
	without the need for any inverse kinematics. We compare our algorithm
	to a recently-developed competing approach and provide results from
	both simulation and a 7 degree-of-freedom robotic arm.},

  abstract = {Path planning for redundant robotic manipulators received continuous
	interest in the past decades. Most efforts focused on random sampling-based
	methods, such as probabilistic roadmap method (PRM) and rapidly-exploring
	random tree (RRT), since they are suitable for planning in high-dimensional
	configuration space. Given the workspace goal position and orientation
	of the end-effector, however, explicitly calculating a collision-free
	and reachable goal configuration for robot joint angles in the presence
	of joint limits and self-collisions is not a trivial work. The difficulty
	forms a bottleneck for the broader applicability of the randomized
	path planning methods. In this paper, a novel two-stage approach
	is presented to implicitly solve the formation of inverse kinematics
	(IK) problems, which employs a variant of RRT to embed the process
	of IK calculation into construction and exploration of the tree-based
	data structure. Combined with bidirectional RRT-connect algorithm,
	the two-stage approach can efficiently address the path planning
	problem for general redundant manipulators. The algorithm has been
	implemented and several 2D and 3D experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
	of the method.},
