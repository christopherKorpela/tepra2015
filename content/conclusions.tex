\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}
Industrial Hygiene monitoring and response functions possess the potential for improving efficiency and safety through the use of robots. Robotic systems such as the GVR-bot can remove humans from dangerous environments while accurately and reliably conducting tasks that are critical to operations on all Army installations. These improvements in efficiency and safety can be obtained in a fiscally responsible manner through the use of existing Army systems. Additionally, research conducted at the Academy benefits the Army long-term by exposing future officers to Army programs and technology at the beginning of their career.
