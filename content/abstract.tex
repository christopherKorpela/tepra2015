A framework is proposed for industrial hygiene inspection using a remotely-operated ground vehicle with multiple sensor payloads attached to it for detecting various hazardous gases and chemicals. A control scheme and a graphical user interface between the vehicle and operator is strictly mandated for tasks requiring remote inspection. Through leveraging existing navigation and path planning algorithms, the system can autonomously patrol hazardous areas and report dangerous levels back to the user. This paper presents recent results validating the industrial hygiene framework using the proposed system during sensor tests.
