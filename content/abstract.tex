\begin{abstract}
A framework is proposed for industrial hygiene inspection using a remotely-operated ground vehicle with multiple sensor payloads attached to it for detecting various hazardous gases and chemicals. A control scheme and a graphical user interface between the vehicle and operator is strictly mandated for tasks requiring remote inspection. This paper presents recent results validating the industrial hygiene framework using the proposed system during sensor tests.
