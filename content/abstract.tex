A framework is proposed for industrial hygiene inspection using a remotely-operated ground vehicle with multiple sensor payloads attached to it for detecting various hazardous gases and chemicals. A control scheme and a graphical user interface between the vehicle and operator is strictly mandated for tasks requiring remote inspection. By leveraging existing navigation and path planning algorithms, the system can autonomously patrol hazardous areas and relay all measurements taken back to the user. This paper presents recent validation testing results of the system and its sensors using the proposed industrial hygiene framework.
