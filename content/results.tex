\section{Sensor Testing and Results}\label{sec:results}

Since gas sensors are inherently inaccurate due to their manufacturing processes and biases, each sensor had to be calibrated by graphing the output of each sensor compared to the known gas in the testing environment. The testing environments consists of 1.0 liter sealed containers with the sensor inserted into one end and a septum for needles inserted in the other as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:sensor}. The 1.0 liter volume simplified the calculations in parts-per-million (ppm) and each gas was introduced to the environment via a syringe and needle.

\end{figure}

By comparing the sensor output (x-axis) to the known concentration of gas in the testing environment (y-axis), a curve is formed, which can be best fit to an exponential curve by focusing the comparison on moderately to severely dangerous gas concentrations, which is approximately 2,000 to 10,000 ppm. The best fit equation for the most accurate test is used in software to correct the sensor output to the most accurate output for transmission to the operator through the OCU. Figs. \ref{fig:methanetest}-\ref{fig:hydrogen} displays the graph for the MQ-4 (Methane) sensor along with the graphs for MQ-6 (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), MQ-7 (Carbon Monoxide), and MQ-8 (Hydrogen) sensors.

Using the correction equations in software with the given sensor outputs, the final results closely match the expected concentrations. The corrected outputs will be able to discern the difference between a safe and a dangerous environment.
