\section{Navigation}\label{sec:navigation}

The internal computer of the GVR-Bot passes sensor data to the on-board, external embedded computer for processing, map generation, and development of a navigation scheme. The external embedded computer is directly connected and receives updates from the LiDar in real-time. The tilting capability of the LiDar allows 3-D point cloud data to be collected for use in developing a 3-D navigation solution. For the purposes of this proposal, accurate inertial measurements were not a requirement because navigation occurs in highly structured indoor environments, and odometry data helps mitigate errors in position. The computer then uses the laser data to generate a 2-D planar occupancy grid map.
